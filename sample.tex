\begin{abstract}
In this research, the problem of \researchproblem{model selection for automated clustering} is considered. \objective{To overcome the theoretical impossibility of a universal clustering measure, and to select a clustering model in an agnostic manner}, it is proposed \method{to evaluate a clustering only as a partition, not depending on data points. We consider entropy as such measure, but to prevent entropy-based model selection from trivial results we apply the method of correction for chance. We propose a new randomness model for entropy adjustment, as randomness models for adjusted mutual information are inapplicable to it}. We illustrate experimentally that \result{the optimum of adjusted entropy is not trivial and compare adjusted entropy with Silhouette and Davies-Bouldin scores}. \conclusion{With relatively small true numbers of clusters adjusted entropy outperforms other metrics}.
